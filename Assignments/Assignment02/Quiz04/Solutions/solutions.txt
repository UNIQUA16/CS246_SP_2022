Given that data = [5,6,2,7,1,8,9,3], show what data will be after two executions of the core 
algorithm of the bubble sort. 

solution:
data = [2,5,1,6,7,3,8,9]

Explain what the core algorithm of the insertion sort does?

solution:
It places an unsorted element into its correct position in the sorted section 
of the collection.
