If the set of keys are strings of length 2 that consists of only of digit characters excluding 0 and 
the hash table has 10 slots, what is the load factor of the table?

Solution:
# of keys = 81
# of slots = 10
load factor = ceiling(81/10) = 9

When would direct addressing be used?

Solution:
When the number of keys is less than or equal to the number of slots and the 
hash function is one-to-one.
